    <div class="title"><h1>About Child Labor</h1></div>
    <div class="content">    <p>Child labor is defined as “...work that is inappropriate for a child's age, affects their education, or is likely to harm their health and safety.” </p>
        <div class="images"><img src="images/child-labor.webp" alt="An example of child labor." height="500"></div>
        <p>Facts about child labor globally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More than 150 million children work as child laborers, and about half of them are in hazardous work sectors. That's almost a tenth of the world's children in child labor.</li>
            <li>Child labor compromises education for many children. It is reported that about a quarter of child laborers aged 5-11 are out of school.</li>
            <li>Progress against child labor has stalled in recent years. It is estimated that the number of child laborers rose by 8 million in the period 2016-2020.</li>
            <li>Ores that are mined by illegal artisanal mining is not able to be differentiated once it enters the supply chain. This makes it more difficult to crack down on child labor in the mining work sector.</li>
            <li>The most important factor in stopping child labor is a strong government with authority and leadership to crack down on these practices.</li>
        </ul>
